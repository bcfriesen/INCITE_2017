{\bf Research Interests and Expertise}
{\parindent 16pt

I am interested in applying computational science skills to problems that demand interdisciplinary scientific skillsand knowledge. My current focus is on stellar astrophysics. My Ph.D. dissertation is on the subject of determining the progenitor systems of the astrophysical explosions known as Type Ia supernovae. To this end, I contribute to the development of the code I use for the research, and I am working on a number of algorithms to improve the study of systems that may result in these explosions. In particular, I have worked on upgrades to the gravity, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics modules of our code. I also have spent time working on one-dimensional stellar evolution modelling. My undergraduate research focused on magnetohydrodynamics in the interstellar medium.
