We will explore two classes of stellar explosions: Type Ia supernovae
and X-ray bursts through high-resolution, multiphysics hydrodynamics
simulations.  Our simulation codes, Maestro and Castro, are well-tuned
to the OLCF titan machine, utilizing a hybrid approach to parallelism
and beginning to offload time-consuming microphysics calculations to
the GPUs.
