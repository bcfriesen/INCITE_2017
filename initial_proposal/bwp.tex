A black widow pulsar (BWP) is a binary system consisting of a low mass
star and a pulsar, a rapidly rotating highly magnetized NS.  The
intense radiation from the pulsar ablates the outer layers of the
stellar companion, leaving behind a very low mass star that is
eventually be completely disrupted \cite{bednareksitarek2013}. Curiously,
pulsars in these systems seem
to be relatively massive, possibly due to accretion of substantial
amounts of their companions.  Uncertainties in the size and shape of
the ablating companion, however, preclude an exact determination of
the pulsar's mass. If the companion is point-like, the inferred mass
is small.  If the companion is able to fill its Roche Lobe, allowing
its mass to spill onto the pulsar, the inferred mass would be much
larger. Our proposed study study will be the first to address modeling
this problem with full 3D radiation hydrodynics simulations to thereby
better interpret observations. There have been no multi-D radiation
hydrodynamical simulations of black widow pulsars that we are aware
of, so the developments enabled here have the potential of being
revolutionary and include removing uncertainty in the inferred mass of
the pulsar, an important step in discerning the equation of state of
dense matter.
