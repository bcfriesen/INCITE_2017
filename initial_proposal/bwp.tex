A black widow pulsar (BWP) is a binary system consisting of a low mass
star and a rapidly rotating neutron star (a pulsar).  The intense
radiation from the pulsar interacts with the stellar companion,
ablating its outer layers, leaving behind a very low mass star.  The
interaction of the radiation field and the star is not very well
understood.  Several such systems are known, and simulations can
help interpret what we see.

There have been no radiation hydrodynamical simulations of black widow
pulsars that we are aware of, so the developments enable here have the
potential of being revolutionary.
